<p>In Kate Wagner's article 404 Page Not Found, she explores the shift in internet design and how early web aesthetics, once viewed as chaotic and unappealing, have now become a beloved form of nostalgic art. This article discusses how internet design has evolved from the personalized, DIY style of Myspace to the minimalist, corporate controlled design of Facebook and Instagram. What was interesting to me  is how early web design elements, like excessive flashing graphics and bright colors, which were once seen as “poor design”, are now embraced and turned into a profitable aesthetic on platforms like Instagram. Wagner uses this shift to highlight how the internet has changed from a space for personal expression to a corporate controlled space focused on consumerism.</p>
    <p>Wagner connects nostalgia to capitalism by showing how early internet culture has been turned into something profitable. She explains that platforms like Instagram take old internet aesthetics and turn them into something to be sold, “serving as a platform where the internet's past is turned into consumable nostalgia.” This relates to what Fredric Jameson calls a "simulacrum," meaning a copy of something that no longer has its original value. I agree with Wagner’s statement, as Instagram, once the main attraction before TikTok, has now become more focused on monetization. With frequent updates, including the addition of the shop feature, Instagram now feels more like a tool for generating profit rather than a platform for genuine user engagement and creativity. Wagner notes that the internet used to be more rebellious and anti-corporate, but now its past is being rebranded to support the very system it once opposed.</p>
<p>The section of Facbook V.s Teen was the section that stood out to me the most. This section reflects on the decline of Myspace and the broader shift from a creative, user-controlled internet to a more streamlined, corporate-controlled one. It highlights how Myspace allowed users. especially teens. to fully customize their pages with different graphics, song clips, and unique layouts, unlike Facebook, which was more restrictive but seen as more “elite” and professional.</p>
<p>The essay references danah boyd’s work, which discusses how this shift was influenced by class and race dynamics. Some users saw Myspace as “ghetto,” while Facebook was seen as a place for “honors kids.” Facebook’s exclusivity, starting at Ivy League schools, reinforced this perception, making it more appealing to parents and students who wanted a higher-status platform.
This topic is interesting because, today, Facebook is one of the apps losing popularity. What was once considered “elite” is now mostly used to keep in touch with family or look up specific people. The same platform that once symbolized status and professionalism has become outdated for younger generations, who now prefer more visual and fast-paced social media like Instagram and TikTok.</p>
<p>When Myspace deleted most of its content in 2013 without warning, it erased personal history, reinforcing the idea that “the artifacts of internet life are personal . . . and therefore worthless.” However, some parts of Myspace’s aesthetic like glitter graphics still survive on old websites, showing what online creativity used to look like. The author describes the loss as deeply personal, saying, “The emotion I felt upon discovering that my old MySpace page was deleted (My Chemical Romance soundbite and all) was sharp like discovering a loving card from an ex at the bottom of a junk drawer.”</p>
<p>This part of the section highlights how deeply people can become emotionally attached to online spaces, especially when they hold personal memories. It reminds me of how people reacted when TikTok was banned for 12 hours back in January, many were worried about losing their jobs, access to important information, or even their creative outlets. While Tik Tok and MySpace are two different platforms they both show how digital spaces can become deeply personal. It becomes a space for self expression and connection. </p>
