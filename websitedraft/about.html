      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="blue">The Foundation for Gaming Deconstruction and Narrative Analysis (FGDNA) is dedicated to uncovering hidden meanings, alternative interpretations, and deeper truths within video game lore. By blending psychology, mythology, and media analysis, we strive to push players to question widely accepted storylines. Our goal isn’t just to entertain, it’s to spark critical discussions about the narratives we consume and how they influence our perception of storytelling. We believe that video games are not just a form of entertainment but a complex art form that mirrors societal values, cultural shifts, and personal experiences. Through a lens that challenges traditional narratives, we examine character arcs, symbolism, world-building, and underlying themes to reveal layers of meaning that may often be overlooked. By analyzing how games shape our understanding of morality, identity, power, and conflict, we encourage players to reflect on the broader implications of these stories in the real world. FGDNA seeks to create a space where discourse thrives, fostering a community of players who engage with games on a deeper, more thoughtful level and empowering them to think critically and challenge the narratives they encounter.
