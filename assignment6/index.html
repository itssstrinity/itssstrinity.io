            <p>“When I Get Home in Solange Knowles’ own words is a Texan film. The visuals for her album come together into a 40-minute-long piece of visual performance art, with each of her 17 tracks and interludes having an accompanying visual. Motifs and homages to Texas culture are steady features throughout. The vision for the film was conceptualized in the wake of the devastation left behind by Hurricane Harvey, and it is fitting, as the idea of exploring ways to combat destruction is central to the piece. Beyond environmental destruction, this piece is attempting to combat the erasure of blackness.Before dissecting the formal aspects of the piece and its relation to the Black past and future, it is essential to define the concepts of Afrosurrealism and Afrofuturism as invoked and applied throughout this paper. Afrosurrealism is defined as a multidisciplinary aesthetic and framework that seeks to cultivate alternative ways of understanding Black people. The term was first coined by American Writer and revolutionary Amiri Baraka, as he used it to describe the work of American Born writer Henry Dumas. Baraka was particularly interested in how Dumas was able to create organic fictional worlds that were still connected to the contemporary world that he lived in (Baraka, 2). This idea of connectedness to the real world is not only a key aspect of Afrosurrealism, but it is what allows it to be a poignant tool in When I Get Home.”

            <p>Afrofuturism is concerned with more than just the future of Black people. The Black past and the active efforts to erase it are viewed as driving forces for Afrofuturism. Filmmaker, theorist, and Afrofuturist Kodwo Eshun notes in his article, entitled “Further Considerations of Afrofuturism,” that the history of imperial racism and the exclusion of Black people from the creation of a collective future has led to a need to develop counter memories that contest the colonial archive (Eshun, 288). However, these counter-memories are not meant to skew or leave out the dark aspects of the Black past, but rather to give Black creators agency over the stories they can tell. Solange definitely enacts Afrofuturism through her depictions of Black people and technology. As Black people, the current context of our lives is one that is filled with oppression and the possibility of premature death. This reality makes it difficult for us to imagine a future where we are present. Even so, it is these same conditions that drive us to imagine a future where our possibilities aren’t chained to systematic oppression. It is a future that is born out of a desire to escape from our current status. Afrofuturism is a tool that Solange is able to use to imagine what this Black future can look like beyond our current state of oppression. In this sense, I will be using Dr. Susana Morris’ definition of Afrofuturism to explain its application in When I Get Home. She defines Afrofuturism as “a way of knowing, understanding, and creating in the world that transgresses the bounds of Western notions of progress, identity, and futurity” (Morris, 34). Solange’s use of Black people and technology has a purpose larger than aesthetics. Their juxtaposition in the piece allows Solange to speak on new possibilities for blackness.”

            <p>Afrofuturism, to me, is one of the most powerful tools Black creators have to reclaim their past while also shaping their future. I completely agree that Afrofuturism is not just about envisioning a distant future but also about resisting the erasure of Black history. The idea of “counter-memories” that challenge the colonial archive resonates deeply because so much of Black history has either been rewritten or omitted altogether. Through art, music, and literature, Black creators like Solange, Octavia Butler, and Janelle Monáe take control of their narratives, proving that Black existence is not limited to suffering but is also full of innovation, resilience, and boundless creativity. I also agree that Afrofuturism is not just about escaping oppression but about imagining a reality where Black people thrive beyond systemic barriers. The fusion of Black culture with technology, as seen in When I Get Home, allows for new representations of Blackness that go beyond traditional expectations. It’s exciting to see artists use their platforms to create alternative futures that redefine what it means to be Black. Afrofuturism isn’t just fantasy—it’s a radical act of self-determination, a way for Black people to claim space in the past, present, and future.
