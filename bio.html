      <p>I'm a graphic designer at Columbia College Chicago, originally from the West Side of Chicago. My work blends creativity with purpose, from visual storytelling and branding to typography. Along with my passion for design, I’m a Social Media Intern for Columbia’s admissions, helping to engage and connect with students through digital content. I’m also involved in student government as the Senator for Diversity and Inclusion, advocating for student voices and a more inclusive campus. In my free time, I love to read, creatively direct. I am curretnly reading "Poppy War," by R.F Kaung. </p>
